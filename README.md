# Hand-Controlled-Mouse


AI Virtual Mouse
A programme called AI Virtual Mouse allows us to use our hands to control the mouse cursor. This programme allows us to carry out a variety of tasks. Even though we are far from the computer, we can control our cursor.


Functionality:
1.	Avoid Action
By just keeping your hand open, you may stop the application from taking any action. If your palm is open, the mouse won't move no matter how you move your hand.

2.	Move Cursor
To manipulate the cursor, simply spread your index and middle fingers together. While moving your hand, your hand will move the cursor along with it.

3.	Left Click
To initiate left click just simply fold your index finger.

4.	Right Click
To initiate right click just simply fold your middle finger.

5.	Drag an Item
To move an object, first approach it, then close your palm and move it in the desired direction.
